A simple Internet of Things application

## Purpose

This device notifies its subscribers through a mobile app when the bathroom has been unlocked. Impatient users may also use it to remotely knock at the bathroom door.
But really, this is a concise exercise for building a relatively polished IoT application with minimum effort.

## Technologies used

* [Spark Core](http://spark.io) for the microcontroller and IoT cloud
* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) for the PCB board design
* [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) for the mobile app
* [Ionic UI Framework](http://ionicframework.com) for the mobile app UI
